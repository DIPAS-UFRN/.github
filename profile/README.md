DIPAS is a research-based organization at Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Norte (UFRN) dedicated to the development of digital image processing algorithms for agricultural applications. We are focused on advancing the use of digital technologies to improve the efficiency and accuracy of agricultural production and decision-making.

Our mission is to research, develop and promote digital image processing algorithms for agricultural applications. We aim to create innovative solutions that can help farmers, agronomists and other agricultural professionals to make better decisions and increase their productivity and profitability.

## Our Team

The DIPAS team is composed of researchers from the UFRN, experts in the field of digital image processing and agricultural science. Our team is made up of:

| Name | Role |
| --- | --- |
| Dra. Alessandra Mendes | Lead Researcher and Professor at UFRN |
| Luan Magioli | Researcher and Master Student at UFRN |
| Yuri Felipe | Researcher and Systems Analyst |

## Our Research

Our research focuses on the development of algorithms for digital image processing in agricultural applications. We are working on solutions for:

- Precision agriculture
- Seeds, seedlings, leafs and sapplings analysis
- Ants analysis

We are also working on improving the accuracy and reliability of existing algorithms and developing new ones.
